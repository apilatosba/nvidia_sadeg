# :volcano: A Vulkan Module for Jai

Just a module to use Vulkan in Jai. Both the header and the loader are generated from vk.xml by the code in this repository.

## [Header](vulkan_header.jai)

Not much to say about [the header](vulkan_header.jai). It should just pick up the types from `vk.xml` and try to format them in Jai with some hopefully useful comments.

## [Loader](vulkan_loader.jai)

There are instructions for usage of the loader in [the file itself](vulkan_loader.jai). It defines globals that will hold the procedure pointers to the API procedures. Then by using the three `load_vulkan_*` procedures you'll be able to fill all these global procedure pointers and start using them.

## Notes

**This module is not extremely active** at the moment because I'm not personally using Vulkan too much these days, that said, I try to keep it up-to-date with the major versions of Vulkan. In a similar fashion, Jai often changes significantly between beta versions so it's possible that some things in it don't compile with the latest versions of the language/compiler.

The way `vk.xml` is modified doesn't make it particularly easy to keep track of all of the stuff they are adding either, and at times I can't justify the bandwidth of reacting to everything they add that doesn't follow previous conventions. The code that parses `vk.xml` was the first thing I wrote in the language, and can be done much better, while also accounting for all the changes that the xml file has had since then.

## License

I want people to be able to just use this without thinking about licensing, although give me a shout if you do use it and attribution is appreciated 😊. Replicating STB's (https://github.com/nothings/stb) licensing stuff where you can choose to use public domain or MIT.
